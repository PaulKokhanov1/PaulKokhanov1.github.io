					Raspberry Pi Drone
				</p>
		
				<p class="project-desc">
					Over the course of the summer, my previous coop gave me a stipend to use for skill development. 
					I decided to learn to build a drone. I connected with someone on the internet offering a course for drone building and they mentored me into learning to create a drone from scratch. 
					Firstly the drone is controlled via a Pixhawk which is microcontroller based, so inorder to get linux functionality on the FC we used a raspberry pi. 
					Basically so we could do computer vision based control we can communicate to the raspberry pi via our ground station, i.e my laptop. 
					The firmware that runs on our flight controller is ardupilot, the firmware interacts with and commands the hardware. 
					Now we chose a microcontroller based board over a linux based board, for example the Navio is for a few reasons
